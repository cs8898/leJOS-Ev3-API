# leJOS-Ev3-API

important note
==============
in order to use this lipary you have to symlink my src to yours
Maybe its just me but i cant add the JAR to the build path

what i have done
================
- made sensors more easy to use (only the get value; the modes are still the same)
 * UltrasonicSensor
 * ColorSensor
 * TouchSensor
 * GyroSensor

what i will do
==============
- LCD Printing Text with \n and auto new Line
- add some dualMotorControler it isn't available now

what i won't do
===============
- edit motors (they are really great)



Addition to LCD
===============
- System.out.println() is working on the Ev3 Display
  so i will delete this by the next changes
